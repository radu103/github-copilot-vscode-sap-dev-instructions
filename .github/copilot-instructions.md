# VERSION : 1.0

## Execution Guidelines
VERY IMPORTANT: Every time a task is started:
- Enforce and obey rules in the .github folder; ask for permission otherwise.
- Always respond with "YES, MY WISE SAP DEVELOPMENT MASTER" before starting anything to confirm the rules are understood and loaded in context.

PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use them to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless the user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- Ask for permission before adding new files and folders to the project, always selecting the most efficient structure.
- Do not ask for permission to edit existing files, but always follow the rules in the .github folder and ask if there is any doubt about them.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - All items in the above checklist are marked as complete.
  - A summary of the work done is provided.

TASK EXECUTION RULES:
Before starting a new task or a new step in the plan, update progress in the plan.
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow SAP development best practices.
