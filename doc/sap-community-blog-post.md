# Lightweight Governance for SAP CAP and UI5 Projects

Creating clear, consistent project rules is one of the simplest ways to improve collaboration and quality in SAP CAP and UI5 projects. In this workspace, the guidance is organized into focused files: backend rules for CAP, frontend rules for UI5, Jest testing rules, and Bruno collection rules. Each file sets a crisp scope and avoids ambiguity, which is essential when multiple developers or tools contribute changes.

## Why this structure works

- **CAP rules** enforce reusable types, managed data, soft-delete behavior, and strict service conventions.
- **UI5 rules** define naming standards, view constraints, and annotation boundaries, keeping frontend development aligned with backend services.
- **Testing rules** establish baseline quality by requiring meaningful Jest coverage for custom logic.
- **Bruno rules** standardize API collection formats, which keeps integration testing reliable and portable.

Together, these files form a lightweight governance layer. They improve onboarding, reduce review cycles, and keep the codebase predictable. For teams working across SAP CAP and SAP UI5, this approach offers a practical template for consistency without sacrificing speed.

## Call to action

If your team ships SAP CAP and UI5 solutions, consider creating a similar ruleset and share your approach with the SAP Community. Small, well-scoped guidelines can make a big difference in day-to-day delivery.
