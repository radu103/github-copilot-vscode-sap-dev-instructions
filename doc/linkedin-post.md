Clear rules speed-up development for SAP CAP + UI5 delivery.

I believe in sharing what I use for productivity our best work comes from helping each other grow.

In this project, I release my own instructions for Github  Copilot - free models (0.0x ones):
• Backend rules (SAP CAP)
• Frontend rules (SAP UI5)
• Testing (Jest)
• API collection (Bruno)

Focused standards reduce ambiguity, speed onboarding, and raise consistency—small governance, big impact.

If you have rules or lessons, release them freely and help others deliver better, faster. Let’s build a stronger SAP community together.

Enjoy and let me know if you have some for #fiori extensions !
